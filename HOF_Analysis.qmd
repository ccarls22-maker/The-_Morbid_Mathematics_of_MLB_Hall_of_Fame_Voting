# The Morbid Mathematics of Hall of Fame Voting

Okay, let's be real. I did this whole data thing for one reason: I'm still mad about Ron Santo.

First, full disclosure: I loved Ron Santo so much I named my dog after him. Yes, my beloved mut is named Santo. He's a good boy who deserves better than the raw deal his namesake got from those Hall of Fame voters.

So there I was, crying for the hundredth time watching "This Old Cub"—if you haven't seen it, it follows Ron Santo's life battling Type 1 Diabetes while being the heart of the Chicago Cubs Organization. And the part that absolutely wrecks me? His widow Vicki answering the phone in their empty house to hear the news: "Ron's been elected to the Hall of Fame."

# One year after he died. ONE. YEAR.

This got me thinking: Are Hall of Fame voters just... ghouls? Do they only appreciate greatness once someone's six feet under? I mean, Ron waited his entire life for that call. He'd literally gather his family around the phone every voting day, hoping. Nothing.

Then he dies. Suddenly he's Hall-worthy.

# So I spent an hour with Python asking: Do dead players get more votes?


```{python}
import pandas as pd

```{python}
HOF = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/court/Downloads/Data_Deep_Dive_Ron_Santo_HOF\HOF.csv")

```{python}

```{python}

```

```{python}
HOF['Date Diff'] = (HOF['DOD'] - HOF['Year']).where(HOF['DOD'] != 0, np.nan)

```{python}

plt.scatter(HOF['Year'], HOF['Date Diff'], alpha=0.5)

```

```{python}
# USE THIS FOR LATER!!!

HOF2 = HOF.copy()
```

```{python}

# Getting a rouch idea where trend may lie 

```{python}

plt.title('Year vs Date Diff')

print("Died after Vote:", (HOF2['Date Diff'] > 0).sum())
print("Died before Vote:", (HOF2['Date Diff'] < 0).sum())

# What I Thought vs. What the Numbers Say

Okay, so my petty theory about voters being ghouls? Turns out I was kind of wrong. (My dog Santo is giving me a disappointed look.)

# So Let's Looking at the actual numbers:

The "Dead Around Voting Time" Crew: 57 players

- Died same year: 9 players (the true "sympathy vote" candidates)

- Died 1-5 years before: 17 players

- Died 1-4 years after: 17 players

- Died 5-9 years after: 14 players

So yeah, there's some death-related voting happening. If you died the same year? You probably got some pity points. But here's what blew my mind:

# The REAL Winners: 107 players who died 10+ YEARS after voting!
That's right—the single biggest group by far isn't the recently deceased. It's the guys who hung around for a DECADE OR MORE after their final vote. These players had time to:

- See their stats age like fine wine

- Watch analytics make their case for them

- Become "statesmen of the game"

# The Living Legends: 77 players still alive

Second biggest group! Turns out voters don't actually need you to be dead. They just need you to... exist for a really long time?

# The Historical Greats: 55 players who died 30+ years before voting

These are the "mythical status" guys. Bud Fowler types. They've been dead so long they're practically baseball deities.

# So let's break it down more surely there's something going on here

## BBWAA 

overwhelmingly elects current or recently retired players who are either still alive or live long after election. This suggests BBWAA focuses on contemporary players.

## Veterans 
serves two distinct purposes:

Correcting historical oversights (the 29 legacy picks)

Electing older players/special cases who die shortly after election 
# I.E. RON SANTO

## Old Timers 
focused on players from earlier eras with a mix of timing.

## Negro League
This was almost exclusively for correcting historical injustices - electing Negro League stars long after their deaths.

Looking at the data, the story becomes clear about how different voting bodies approach Hall of Fame elections, and where Ron Santo's journey fits:

# Ron Santo's Story in Context:

Ron Santo's election wasn't just about his stats (which were Hall-worthy: 9× All-Star, 5× Gold Glove, .277 avg, 342 HR). It was about...

- The emotional wave after his death

- The persistent advocacy of Cubs fans

- The Veterans Committee's specific role as baseball's "second chance" court

His journey from BBWAA rejection (topping out at 43% in 1998) to Veterans Committee election exemplifies why this alternate path exists - to correct what time proves were mistakes, and to honor players whose greatness became clearer in retrospect.

# Final Thought: 

In a system where timing of death influences voting, Santo's posthumous election stands as both a bittersweet victory and a testament to how baseball ultimately corrects its oversights - even if it takes decades and requires a different set of voters to see what the writers missed.
